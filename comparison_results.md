Aku sering banget main game, baik itu di mobile ato di desktop, ya meskipun belakangan ini aku lagi usaha batesin sih… Masih usaha…

Cuman aku merasakan sesuatu yang perbedaan pas aku main game di kedua platform tsb. Seringkali aku main lebih lama di mobile. Buka sedikit, keterusan sampe 4 jam. Keluar dari app, aktivitas bentar, buka dikit lagi, keterusan sampe pagi. Gitu aja terus sampe hapus game baru bisa lepas.

Dari sini, aku tu bertanya-tanya, alesannya kenapa ya? 

Setelah aku merefleksikan habitku dan riset2 dikit, ini 3 alesan yang seringkali gak diperhatiin.

1. Access
2. Convenience
3. Instant

Batasan Masalah :

Atau bisa disebut, ACI. Sebelum aku bahas apa itu ACI, aku mau kasih batesan kalau  kita gak bahas game designnya ya temen2, kayak bagaimana design game gacha seringkali bikin kecanduan, tetapi kita akan berfokus pada platformnya, oke?

Hipotesa :

- Access
    
    Game mobile itu aksesnya gampang, Game mobile itu bisa kamu akses dimana-mana. Kamu tinggal Buka HP > Buka Game > Loading Dikit > Title Screen, Udah, tinggal main.
    
    Sedangkan kalo game desktop kamu perlu untuk Nyalain PC > Booting Windows > Masih Nunggu Fresh Start > Buka Steam > Checking for Update > Buka Game > Checking for Update > Booting Game > Loading Screen > Title Screen, Baru bisa main
    
    Selisihnya jauh cui, akses ini juga masuk ke alasan kedua yaitu Convenience  
    
- Convenience
    
    Bisa dimainkan dengan posisi semaunya
    
- Instant
    
    Proses masuknya gampang
